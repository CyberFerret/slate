# Introduction

Welcome to the HR Partner API documentation.  This site is designed for developers or advanced users of HR Partner to be able to create mini apps or routines to read (and sometimes write) information from our system.

We have created some short code snippets here using some popular languages in order to showcase how to use the API.

You must have an active trial or paid subscription to HR Partner in order to be able to use or test the API.  Sign up for an account now at [www.hrpartner.io](https://www.hrpartner.io)

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
# With Ruby, you need to pass the api key in the header with each request
require 'rest-client'

endpoint = 'https://api.hrpartner.io/employees'
header = {'x-api-key' => 'ee095c2f58da4f36d087ca7794384f4d'}

result = RestClient.get(endpoint, header)

puts result
```


```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "https://api.hrpartner.io/employees"
  -H "x-api-key:ee095c2f58da4f36d087ca7794384f4d"
```

```javascript
var Client = require('node-rest-client').Client;
 
var client = new Client();
var endpoint = "https://api.hrpartner.io/employees";
var info = {headers: {"x-api-key":"ee095c2f58da4f36d087ca7794384f4d"}};

client.get(endpoint, info, function(data, response) {
  console.log(response;
});
```

> Make sure to replace `ee095c2f58da4f36d087ca7794384f4d` with your API key.

HR Partner requires a unique API key to ensure security of any calls to our API.  Every HR Partner company is issued a randomly generated API key that can be accessed by going to **Setup -> Configure -> Integrations** within the main menu (Note: You will have to have full access rights to HR Partner in order to access this menu).  You will also need to activate API access to your company, which is turned off by default for protection of your data.

Always keep your API key safe and secure like you would your password.  Anyone with your API key can access your company data, including all employee information and attachments etc.

If you suspect that your API key has been compromised, you can generate a new one within HR Partner, or else you can turn off API access to your company from the same menu area.

Your API key _must_ be included in all calls to our API gateway, in the header of each call as follows:

`x-api-key:ee095c2f58da4f36d087ca7794384f4d`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>ee095c2f58da4f36d087ca7794384f4d</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>


# Endpoint

The HR Partner API supports a simplified REST protocol.  You may make GET, POST and DELETE calls against our REST endpoint at:

**https://api.hrpartner.io/**

All calls to the endpoint _must_ be made using the HTTPS secure protocol.  Calls made over HTTP will either be automatically re-routed to HTTPS or else be ignored.

# Disclaimer

Note: The API is still in Beta at this point in time, so the information below is subject to change with little notice.  Where possible, we will try not to make changes to our API interface which will break anything that was written using the older spec, but we reserve the right to make changes to improve performance or improve security without advanced notification during the Beta phase.

# Company

```ruby
require 'rest-client'

header = {'x-api-key' => 'ee095c2f58da4f36d087ca7794384f4d'}
endpoint = 'https://api.hrpartner.io/company'

result = RestClient.get(endpoint, header)

puts result
```

```shell
curl "https://api.hrpartner.io/company"
  -H "x-api-key:ee095c2f58da4f36d087ca7794384f4d"
```

```javascript
var Client = require('node-rest-client').Client;
 
var client = new Client();
var info = {headers: {"x-api-key":"ee095c2f58da4f36d087ca7794384f4d"}};
var endpoint = "https://api.hrpartner.io/company";

client.get(endpoint, info, function(data, response) {
  console.log(response;
});
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
{
  "name": "Acme Industries",
  "slug": "adme-industries",
  "logo_image_link": "AyJfTPg769sI1wVSxQVwBQ/logo/acme_logo.png",
  "subdomain": "acme",
  "subscribed": true,
  "subscribed_until": "2099-03-21T00:00:00+00:00",
  "employee_limit": 50,
  "total_employees": 31,
  "active_employees": 26,
  "timezone": "Australia/Sydney",
  "sms_credits": 1.0
}
```

This endpoint retrieves your basic company data from HR Partner.

### HTTP Request

`GET https://api.hrpartner.io/company`

This call will return basic company information from HR Partner, including the company name, your subscription expiry information and employee counts.  It is useful for validating that you are communicating with the correct HR Partner company.

This endpoint retrieves a single employee from the system using their **_Employee Code_**.

### HTTP Request

`GET https://api.hrpartner.io/employee/{employeeCode}`

This call will return a lot more detail about an individual employee, including all their contact details, address details, as well as any custom fields that you may have created within your HR Partner company.


<aside class="notice">Tip: You can use the <code>GET /employees</code> call to get a list of all employees, then extract the <em>code</em> field from the results to fetch individual employees.</aside>

code<sup>*</sup> | text | The employee code
first_names | text | The first (and optionally, middle) name of the employee
last_name | text | The surname of the employee

_<sup>*</sup> - Mandatory (required) field_

_<sup>+</sup> - If the field contains data that isn't already in HR Partner, it will be added to the list of drop down options_

Please note that the employee code is also required in the POST body as well as the URL for added verification and security.

#### Custom Data

The `custom_data` object within the employee data object will contain the field names and field contents of any custom fields that you have added to your HR Partner company.  Probably the best option is to execute a `GET` call on the `/employee/{employeeCode}` endpoint to get a current employee object and look at the structure of it to ascertain the exact structure of the object that needs to get sent back in the `POST` call.

<aside class="success">
  <strong>Note:</strong> You don't need to have ALL the custom fields in the <code>custom_data</code> object.  You only need to have the fields you want to update, and any fields not included will not be modified.
</aside>

#### Tags

The `tags` object contains an array of custom tags that you can allocate to the employee.

Parameter | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
tag | text | Tag name

Please note the construction of this object carefully.  It is not simply an array of strings, but rather an array of objects (see example of fetched employee data above).

If you use a tag that doesn't exist in HR Partner, that tag will get added to the list of tags, as well as being allocated to the employee.


#### Employee Contacts

This object contains the various contact items against the employee.

Parameter | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
id | number | The internal ID number of the contact data. If included, the contact details will be **updated**. If omitted, the contact details will be **added**
type | text | Must be one of: _Phone, Email, Mobile, Fax, Pager, Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, Skype, Instagram, GitHub_

is_primary | true/false | Flag for whether this address is primary (will be used as default address for system emails or SMSs) 


#### Employee Addresses

This object contains the various address data against the employee.

This endpoint retrieves a single applicant from the system using the **_Applicant ID_**.  It will also return any job applications (if any) that this applicant has created in the system.

### HTTP Request

`GET https://api.hrpartner.io/applicant/{applicantID}`

This call will return a single applicant based on the unique _Applicant ID_ from HR Partner.

Note: The Applicant ID can be either the unique ID string that you obtain from the applicants list above, or else you can use the applicant's email address.  Email addresses are also treated as the unique identifier for applicants within HR Partner.


<aside class="notice">Tip: You can use the <code>GET /applicants</code> call to get a list of all applicants, then extract the <em>ID</em> field from the results to fetch individual applicants.  Or else just use their email address as the ID, which you can also get from the above call.</aside>

This endpoint will update _certain fields_ for an applicant and/or their job application.

### HTTP Request

`POST https://api.hrpartner.io/applicant`

A successful POST will return a applicant object (see the `GET /applicant` call above) upon successful modification.

<aside class="warning">
  <strong>Note:</strong> This call will create the applicant if the email address does not already exist in the system, or it will update the details of the applicant if the email address already exists.
</aside>

### POST Body

The JSON packet that can be POSTed to the endpoint is a subset of the JSON that you receive from the GET call to the `/applicant` endpoint.

Parameter | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
email<sup>*</sup> | text | The applicant email address
first_names | text | The applicants first name
last_name | text| The applicants last name
job_applications | array | An array of one or more jobs that the applicants is applying for

The following describes the fields in the `job_applications` array:

Parameter | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
id<sup>*</sup> | text | The job listing unique slug (see `/job_listing` endpoint)
stage | text | The stage of the job application pipeline that the candidate is in (must be an existing stage name)


_<sup>*</sup> - Mandatory (required) field_

<aside class="info">
  <strong>Note:</strong> You can change the Stage of the pipeline that the applicant is in by specifying an existing applicant email and name in the first part of the POST body, then specifying the job listing slug and the Stage name in the second part (the `job_applications` array).  Specifying a different Stage name will just move the applicant into that stage immediately.
</aside>

This endpoint retrieves a single job application from the system using the **_Application ID_**.

### HTTP Request

`GET https://api.hrpartner.io/application/{applicationID}`

This call will return a single application based on the unique _Application ID_ from HR Partner.

<aside class="notice">Tip: You can use the <code>GET /applications</code> call to get a list of all application, then extract the <em>ID</em> field from the results to fetch individual applications.</aside>

This endpoint will either add a new application, or else update _certain fields_ for an existing application.

### HTTP Request

`POST https://api.hrpartner.io/application`

A successful POST will return a application object (see the `GET /application` call above) upon successful modification.

<aside class="warning">
  <strong>Note:</strong> This call will create the application if you do not specify the `id` field in the JSON POST body.  If you specify a valid ID then the application will be updated.  This call will also create the applicant if the email address does not already exist in the system, or it will update the details of the applicant if the email address already exists.
</aside>

### POST Body

The JSON packet that can be POSTed to the endpoint is a subset of the JSON that you receive from the GET call to the `/application` endpoint.

Parameter | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
id | numeric | (Optional) - Specify an existing id to update it.  Leave this field off if you want to create a new application


The following describes the fields in the `applicant` tree:

Parameter | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
email<sup>*</sup> | text | The applicant email address
first_names | text | The applicants first name
last_name | text| The applicants last name


The following describes the fields in the `job_listing` tree:

Parameter | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
id<sup>*</sup> | text | The job listing unique slug (see `/job_listing` endpoint)


The following described the fields in the `stage` tree:

Parameter | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
name | text | The stage of the job application pipeline that the candidate is in (must be an existing stage name)


_<sup>*</sup> - Mandatory (required) field_


<aside class="info">
  <strong>Note:</strong> You can change the Stage of the pipeline that the applicant is in by specifying an existing applicant email and name in the `applicant` section of the POST body, then specifying the job listing ID in the `job_listing` section and the Stage name in the `stage` section.  Specifying a different Stage name will just move the applicant into that stage immediately.

  If you specify an invalid Stage name, then the company default stage (usually 'Applied') will be allocated to the application.
</aside>


#### Custom Form Fields

You can also specify the custom form fields for the application in the POST body.  There is a section called `custom_form` and a subsection called `answers`.  You will need to specify the field names that you have defined in your custom form, and the answers to them in here.

<aside class="warning">
  We do not do any cross checking for valid custom form field names.  If you specify an invalid field name or contents, then it will simply be ignored by our form renderer when you are viewing the application later.  We strongly recomment that you call <strong>GET /job_listing</strong> to get the specific job listing first which will show you the custom form field names associated with the job listing, then use this information to build the answer object.
</aside>

For example, assuming you make a call to the `job_listing` endpoint, and within the returned data, you see it will look as per our sample _(EX.1)_ on the right.
